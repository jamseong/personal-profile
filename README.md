# What is important to you? And why? (Max. 250 words)
Throughout my high school career, I have come to understand that not just love, but expressing love was important to me. When my grandfather passed away in my grade 8 year, I regretted the countless times I declined to video chat with him, only because I was busy watching YouTube or playing video games. Ever since then, I take every opportunity to call my grandmother, even during days when I am busy doing homework or just talking with friends. Even if I was feeling down on a day, feigning happiness while seeing her over the phone would make me feel much more in peace when the inevitable news would strike us – at least I took the chance to see her, one last time. This also has extended to not just my family, but also to my friends as well. 

*“Words aren’t always needed to express love.” - Jussi Chydenius*

There was a time in my Grade 10 year when I was going through an identity crisis of whether I really had a place in my friend group. Even with their kind gestures, I believed they were just trying to be nice. One day, as we were parting ways after hanging out, a friend casually said: “Bye, I love you!” However, these words managed to shatter any doubt in my mind whether I was truly loved. Today, whenever I write a letter to my friends, I always end the card with: “You are loved. I love you.”
